Hello, programmers!

My team and I have created a Python kernel called pynext. The kernel code is already available on GitHub.

We invite you to contribute to the kernel. If you have any ideas on how to improve the code or want to join our team, please email us at kdsdk0336@gmail.com. We will definitely consider your suggestions.

To install all the modules that are used in the kernel, you need to open the file install_module_win.bat if you are on Windows and 
if on Linux/Mac OS then installmodule.bash
